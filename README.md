# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
Weekly challenge, on-the-job ticket.

## Description
This week's challenge focuses on creating a professional portfolio using advanced CSS techniques. An effective portfolio is a crucial tool for showcasing your skills and talents to potential employers. It highlights your strongest work and the thought processes behind it. Having a portfolio with deployed web applications greatly increases your chances of getting an interview for a part-time or full-time position.

In this challenge, you will apply core skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to create a responsive and visually appealing portfolio. Even if you don't have many deployed projects yet, you can use placeholders and update them as you build more applications throughout the course.

## Challenge
### User Story
AS AN employer,  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,  
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good fit for an open position.

### Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work, WHEN I load their portfolio, THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application, THEN that application's image is larger than the others.
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
